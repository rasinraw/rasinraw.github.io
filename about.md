>"To free humans from becoming machines, and be more Humane"

<p>Key things that differentiate us humans from other species are ‘tools/tech we create/use’ and ‘collective scale of sustained collaboration and curation of knowledge over ages.’</p>

<p>My mission is to free humans from repetitive tasks via Automation & Artificial Intelligence and to raise superior Human Intelligence / Consciousness to its full potential.</p>

<p>I help end users, customers and organizations save significant time and money by helping them make the best use of tools / technology investments via automation and AI from edge to cloud. </p>
